React is  created by Facebook.

## 2-What are the major features of React?
- **Component-Based Architecture**   
- **Virtual DOM** - Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.  
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)** - JSX syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code  
- **Unidirectional Data Flow** - Follows Unidirectional or one-way data flow or data binding. 
- **Reusable Components** - reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.
- **React Ecosystem**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Supports server-side rendering which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).  
- **Context API**
- **Hooks**
  
 ## 3-What is JSX? ##

## 5-How to create components in React? ##
Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component. 

***Function Components:*** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the one and only one parameter and return React elements to render the output:  

***Class Components:*** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component:  

## 6-What is the Difference UI Rendring methode ?##
***Client-Side Rendering (CSR)***

Client-Side Rendering(**CSR**) is a technique, In which web pages are rendered on the clientâ€™s browser by useing JavaScript to change the DOM element. 
This method with CSR frameworks including Vue.js, React, and Angular. A simple HTML page is first loaded, and future content updates are fetched and rendered dynamically using API requests.

***Server-Side Rendering (SSR)***

***Static Site Generation (SSG)***

***Universal Rendering(UR)***

All are different approaches to rendering web content
